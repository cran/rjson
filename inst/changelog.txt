0.2.6: Oct 17, 2011
	bufix: fromJSON('["A",["B","C"]]') incorrectly returned "A" "B" (thanks Brad Friedman for reporting it)
	bufix: fromJSON('["A", null]', method="R") was using NA rather than NULL (missed case from version 0.1.6)
0.2.4: June 26, 2011
	bugfix: too hasty with the previous release, and introduced a bug for characters greater than 512 bytes (was blindly doubling the buffer size when sometimes it needed more)
0.2.4: June 25, 2011
	bugfix: memory issue when parsing strings with mostly (or only) escaped characters greater than 256bytes
0.2.3: Dec 12, 2010
	bugfix: allow '\r' to b whitespace rather than just use '\n'
0.2.2: Nov 29, 2010
	bugfix: protection stack overflow - now uses PROTECT_WITH_INDEX() rather pushing far too many protects on to the stack
	bugfix: added missing protects to SET_LENGTH calls

0.2.1: unknown (missing entry)

0.2.0: unknown (missing entry)
	introduced a C based parser for reading JSON

0.1.6: August 23, 2009
	fixed toJSON bug: NA, NaN, Inf, -Inf are not converted to strings
	fromJSON: null used to be returned as NA, but now is returned as NULL (but will still have the associated key displayed in the list)
